            <p>
            As a security enthusiast and avid bug bounty hunter, I have a
            proven track record of identifying and responsibly disclosing 
            vulnerabilities in some of the world's largest companies. 
            In addition to my bug bounty experience, I have also completed 
            several college projects that demonstrate my technical skills 
            and problem-solving abilities. I am always eager to learn and 
            tackle new challenges, and I am currently focused on further 
            developing my skills and expertise in the security field.
