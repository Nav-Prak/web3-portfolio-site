            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            As a Master's student in Computer Science at USC, I am deeply passionate about security and cutting-edge technologies. My professional experience includes working at Intel, where I modernized applications to .NET 8 and contributed to achieving over 300K+ man-hours of productivity savings through innovative chatbot enhancements. Additionally, my bug bounty efforts have led to identifying and responsibly disclosing critical vulnerabilities for leading organizations, earning recognition in multiple Hall of Fames. Alongside these experiences, I have worked on impactful academic projects, such as enhancing game engines and implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. I am eager to continue learning, tackling challenges, and advancing my expertise in cybersecurity and advanced computing technologies.            </p>
